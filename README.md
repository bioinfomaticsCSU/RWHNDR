  RWHNDR is a novel network-based computational method, which extends random walk on a heterogeneous network integrating multiple different data sources to predict potential drugs for a specific disease.
  
  1)RWHNDR.m: predict potential drugs for diseases;
  2)P_createPM.m: construct the initial proability vector;
  3)M_P_PreSimM.m: construct the transition matrix;
